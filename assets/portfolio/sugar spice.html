	</div>
	<div class="storybook">
		<div class="graf">You had to go out and buy more all-purpose flour, a large bag of sugar, and three bags of chocolate chips. It had been a long day; the cashier had seen you come in a few times, and reminded you that they were closing soon. You knew this, you promised her, this was the last time she’d see you today. She pressed her lips like a fish, to the side, and handed you your receipt.</div>
			<div class="graf">You pocketed it and thanked her, hustling out. There was enough flour and sugar to last you all night, and if you got the recipe wrong again, you could wait until they reopened. The drive home was fast, hazy. It was hard to see past the dusty smudge on your glasses.</div>
				<div class="graf">The car slid into the parking space, but your back wheel was going over the line. Your neighbors were just going to have to suck it up, apparently. You were in a rush. You had to finish these cupcakes so you could bring them to him tomorrow to apologize. Too much salt and bitterness was your problem, and you knew he didn’t like it, and sometimes you got too bitter. You’d gotten too bitter two days ago, and today he wasn’t responding to your texts. Usually he did. Now he wasn’t. You had been too bitter.</div>
					<div class="graf">He was going to wonder why the cupcakes weren’t sweet enough. You knew he had a real sweet tooth. Slowly, you poured in the flour, into the big bowl that was already covered inside with residue from the last few batches. You dumped in the baking soda, getting more dusty mess on the countertop as you turned around, spinning around the whisk.</div>
						<div class="graf">It wasn’t working. Maybe you could add the cocoa powder and salt, and it would all taste the same then. Yes, yes that would work. </div>
							<div class="graf">You grabbed the big salt cylinder, popped open the nozzle, and poured it in. After that was finished, you grabbed the bag of cocoa powder and held it with one hand as the brown dust fell into the bowl. That was sweet, right? It wasn’t enough right now, no of course not, but that was a good first step. You mix this callously and set it down to the side. </div>
								<div class="graf"> You should get the other things ready. The not-so-sweet things. It’s like you, you think, as you smash the first egg into the sink’s side. Son of a bitch. Shards of shell were everywhere. You were making even more of a mess, stop trying to be so brisk. Carefully, you crack the egg onto the side of the sink, and empty the liquids into the bowl. 	You pick up the whisk and the milk, pouring a dollop of milk into the egg bowl, beating the yolk into nothing but a pastel yellow pulp. If it weren’t for the sugar, you think this would taste so bitter and bland. It’s like you. </div>
									<div class="graf">He would have said it was good enough, though. You mixed, and the liquids sloshed together into light yellow, dull and bland. He would have said something stupid and nice, like how you can’t make cupcakes without the egg. You probably could. They’d be so sweet. The cupcakes you’re making aren’t enough, but he would have said it was good enough, but it wasn’t good for him. </div>
								<div class="graf">You dip your whisk into the cocoa powder dry mix, and lift it to taste. Your suspicions were too right. It was bad for him. It had so much salt in it. Mixing in the eggs and the milk would only make this worse, worse. It’s like you, only worse.</div>
							<div class="graf">Ah, but you hadn’t added the sugar or the chocolate chips yet, all wasn’t just lost. And the butter! You weren’t done! There was still a chance!</div>
						<div class="graf">The box of chocolate chips knocked over when you tried to grab it, and you swore as a few pieces fell off the counter, on top of the tiny mounds of forgotten dust from earlier in the day. Also yesterday. You knew you were going to get ants soon. Good thing he wasn’t here right now. You’re going to bring him the cupcakes, and bring him flowers, and he’d say “Thank you” and kiss your cheek and hold your hand again and tell you you’re wonderful and that he loved you and that it didn’t matter what his dad or his mom said and that you would run away together, you could, should run. He would eat a cupcake and say they’re great. His arms would wrap around your waist while you tried to mix this stupid dusty powder, and call it stupid with you. Maybe he’d say he loved
					<div class="graf">The bowl clattered to the floor, since your sweaty hands sliding right off the sides. You were yanked back into reality, and he disappeared, and the powder fell like rain, scattering in a nice layer on top of the other mistakes. </div>
				<div class="graf">You fell to the ground and cupped at the dust, hissing, begging for it to go back into the bowl, for this to be a mixture that would turn into something edible, tasty, sweet. Something sweet for him, please, it had to be sweet for him. He loved sweet things and if you couldn’t make the cupcakes sweet, who knew what he would do. Maybe he’d even leave. Maybe he’d left. Maybe he’d left because you and the cupcakes weren’t sweet, because you hadn’t added enough sugar or care or love, and now you were alone with your dumb stupid mistakes because you weren’t sweet enough. </div>
			<div class="graf">If you could only bake cupcakes sweet enough, then maybe he’d come back with you. The taste of the chocolate chips he loved so much lingered on your lips as you hoisted yourself off of the ground, hands making wet spots on the counter where you held it. You wiped your glasses and then your hair, and the salty, dull, bland batter dust got into your hair. The bowl of icky, not-sweet was still on the counter. You just had to remake the sweet batter dust.</div>
		<div class="graf">You could do it. More cocoa powder this time. More sugar, more chocolate chips. Sweeter. 
	<div class="graf">You tossed the bowl back onto the counter and held it upright as you lifted the bag of flour again, pouring a white shower into the messy, messy bowl. This was going to work — it had to. You were going to be sweet for him.</div>
