<div class="storybook">
	<div class="graf"> This was how I liked spending my afternoons, my head laying across Master’s lap, her fingers carefully scratching all the right spots on my back. She was sitting on the couch and watching something on the big screen, something that was making a few quiet noises. I don’t like it when she watches things that make loud noises like thunder or loud because sometimes that scares me, but this thing was quiet, and her fingers were really soothing, and he wasn’t here yet. So things were good. Things were very good, so good I was almost asleep. </div>
	<div class="graf">I shuffle around and press my nose against her knee. This kills the mood for me, because the jeans she was wearing smelt like him. We couldn’t have that, he wasn’t here, he wasn’t allowed to taint our time together, not yet. He wasn’t allowed brandish the glittery gold star he had imprisoned on a piece of black darkness on his shirt, not when we were quiet and he was going to be so late and smell so much like alcohol. I stoop my head and lick her knee, trying to get rid of the scent. He wasn’t allowed in yet, not now, not yet.</div>
	<div class="graf">Her hand withdrew, and she let out a giggle while moving her knee. “Bear! No,” she scolded me.</div>
	<div class="graf">I had to finish licking her, though, I had to get rid of his scent. To protect her. So I kept licking. She put her hand in front of my muzzle and pulled her leg away. Doesn’t she understand how upsetting it was that his scent was on her leg? He was hurting her and he wasn’t even here yet!</div>
	<div class="graf">I whimpered sadly and tilted my head down. She usually patted my head and scratched behind my ears, just like that, just like she was doing. Awh, yeah.</div>
	<div class="graf">Bliss swept over me. I growled a little, rolling over onto my stomach as much as I could on the confines of the couch to allow her to scratch my belly. Master obliged, using both hands and brushing them through my fur speedily, scratching out all the knots in my hair. </div>
	<div class="graf">She was so good! “Who’s a good boy? Who’s a good boy, Bear?” My tail slapped against the couch cushion as it wagged. Who was the good boy? Who? What? </div>
	<div class="graf">“You are!” Me? Me?! “You’re a good boy!” I’m a good boy! I bark happily and wave my paws. I’m the good boy!</div>
	<div class="graf"> <i>Screech!</i></div>
	<div class="graf">I can’t avoid that sound. My head turns quickly, as dos Master’s. Her hands stop on my stomach, slowing down and looking at the door. He must be home, but why now? Why does he have to be home, then Master will leave.</div>
	<div class="graf">“It’s pretty late,” Master noticed, too. </div>
<div class="graf">I jump off of her lap and onto my feet on the ground. I lunge towards the front door, off of the carpet, my feet skidding a little bit on the slippery floors.  </div>
<div class="graf">I bump up against the door, running too fast to stop before it, and I immediately smell him, coming closer and closer. I shout at him through the door to go away! Go away and leave me and Master alone! </div>
<div class="graf">“Get Bear out of the doorway, Jamie!” he shouts past the door.</div>
<div class="graf">“Okay!” </div>
<div class="graf">I feel Master grab my collar and tug me backwards, shushing me all the while. I don’t want to go back, though, so I tug against her, growling at him through the door. I can even smell the alcohol on him! “Calm down, Bear, calm down.” She shushes me again and kisses my head, rubbing my side with one hand while she sits me down in the living room. “Calm down. It’s okay.”</div>
<div class="graf">Master sounds calm.  Maybe I am over reacting, maybe I am.  Usually when he comes home like this, so late and with that smell then he is bad to her, but I’ve been wrong before.  Like about the little circle robot on the ground. So I stop. I sit, then lay on the carpet, and finally I hide my face in my paws in disgust as the door creaks open and his scent surrounds me. His footsteps are quick but heavy, and the alcohol smell mingling with his normal smell, two terrible omens. When he came home smelling like that, he and Jamie would make their voices really loud.  I hope they don’t make their voices loud tonight.</div>
<div class="graf">Master must have smelt it too because her quick footsteps went towards his. They whisper together, but I can hear it all. I always hear it all. </div>
<div class="graf">“Don, careful. Were you at the bar again?”</div>
<div class="graf">“What’s it matter to you, huh? Is dinner ready?”</div>
<div class="graf">“Almost. I just have to wash the—”</div>
<div class="graf">“Stupid! Stupid, go finish cooking the fucking dinner so I can eat. I’m hungry like all hell.”</div>
<div class="graf">“Don!  What the fuck, just sit down, alright?  Drink some water, you’re wasted as hell.”</div>
<div class="graf">Their voices disappear down the hall. I carefully remove my paws and stand up. I need to go to the kitchen with them. I’ll keep quiet, I’ll try to, but I have to protect her. I lift my first paw cautiously, making sure to amble as calmly as I could to not jar them.  I need to protect her like she protects me.</div>
<div class="graf">I plop down again in the kitchen, behind the counter window between this room and the dining room. The scent of the food almost calms me down, the roasted chicken embedded in creamy sauce, which sometimes Master gives to me below the table. The first time we met, she gave me roasted chicken to coax me out from my hiding spot in the rain spout. I was young then and she protected me from the elements, gave me a roof to sleep under, and gave me more love than I had ever expected I would receive. I love her, too. That’s why I want to protect her.  I need to protect her.</div>
<div class="graf">I open an eye. Master is cleaning some of the green leaves, breaking them into halves and setting them aside to dry quickly. Her hair is loose, a few strands hanging around her, and she smells of fear. She must know he’s like that right now.  Sometimes he gets like that and that’s why I cannot like him completely. When we first met him, he smelt a bit weird, but he was so nice. He made Master laugh, he made her smell happy and look happy. But then, sometimes, and really sometimes, once, he came home smelling like alcohol, and he and Master yelled and yelled and yelled. Master gave up after some time, but he tried to hurt her that day. He took out a little black stick, a boxy stick, and Master got really scared. Master left that night and slept somewhere else, and I hid in Master’s bed. He didn’t do anything the next day, but he had tried to hurt her. And, sometimes, he still comes back like that, smelling like alcohol and anger. We trusted him. She trusts him, Master thinks he just needs to go to training classes like me and he will be okay. But it’s in his smell. He cannot get better like me. </div>
<div class="graf" class="graf">“Hey! Hurry up with that meal!” </div>
<div class="graf">No one talks meanly to Master. He was standing just above me, leaning over the counter from the dining room, sticking his smelly head into the kitchen. I growl up right at his smelly head.</div>
<div class="graf">He looks down at me, the golden star on his chest flashing, and I bark at him to move out of the way so I would stop being blinded. The star was so loud on my eyes, I hate it, I hate it so much, I want to bite it. He didn’t seem to understand and looks back up at Master.</div>
<div class="graf">He sounds agitated. “Jamie, is something up with Bear?  He keeps growling at me today.”</div>
<div class="graf">“I can’t control him, Don, he’s an animal. Maybe he knows you were at the bar,” Master’s voice was so tired, I was causing her pain. Or was he causing her pain? Either way, I do not want to hurt her. </div>
<div class="graf">I stop shouting out of that thought, but I still look up at him and keep growling. He needs to know how much I hate him. How much he has to leave, leave Master alone and stop hurting her like this. I lay my head back down and watch Master cook. If he wants me to be quiet, I would, if it meant he will not hurt Master today.</div>
<div class="graf">Master looks at me as though to check that I will stay quiet, then looks back up at him. She tries for a smile, she was always trying with him when he was like this. “I had the police scanner on, there were a few calls. You stay safe?”</div>
<div class="graf">“Safe as ever, Janie Jane. We went to the bar, me and the boys on shift. Tom drove the patrol car accidentally so I grabbed a ride home with John,” he takes a sip of water from his cup and sighs, looking down at me.</div>
<div class="graf">I bare my teeth at him.  Fuck him.  </div>
<div class="graf">He rolls his eyes and looks back up at Master. “Think you can speed it up, Jamie?  I’m hungry as hell.”</div>
<div class="graf">“Just steaming some vegetables, hold your horses—”</div>
<div class="graf">“I could eat a fucking horse,” he groans. He doesn’t deserve to be as whiny as he is.</div>
<div class="graf">He was getting angrier, I could hear it in his voice. Master could hear it, too.</div>
<div class="graf">I look up at him and growl again. He just gets on my nerves so much. He should not rush her like that, last time he did Master accidentally cut herself on one of the knives she was using to cut the food. While there are no knives this time, it is  still scary. He looks down at me and leans over the counter, a hand reaching down. I stiffen. He’s going to hit me, just like he tried to hit Master. Well, fuck him! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!</div>
<div class="graf">I snap my jaws in a warning bite on his hand, and I can feel my teeth puncture his finger just a bit.  Still, he shouts as though I cut off his whole hand with my jaws.</div>
<div class="graf">“Don! What did you do?” Oh, he’s in for it now! He’s so in for it now, Master’s going to kick him out!</div>
<div class="graf">“Your fucking mutt bit me!”</div>
<div class="graf">“What? Not Bear,” Master turns to look at me, and I shy away from her angry eyes, “Bear doesn’t bite people unless they want to get bit. What’d you do, Don?”</div>
<div class="graf">“I’m gonna take him out and shoot him, so help me God. This is why I said if you wanted to get another dog we can, Bear’s getting old. ‘Sides, you have me to protect you, you don’t need a dumb dog,” he stands up and walks around the island, grabbing my collar.</div>
<div class="graf">I yelp in response, my feet skittering everywhere. I do not want him to take me anywhere! He needs to put me down, why is Master not helping? Where is he taking me?!</div>
<div class="graf">“Don’t do that, please. He didn’t mean to hurt you, you just startled him probably,” she rushed over and tried to push him off of me</div>
<div class="graf">He stumbles and loudly swears, holding onto the wall for support. Master wipes her hands on her pants, scratching me behind the ears. “It’s okay,” she whispers.</div>
<div class="graf">Damn right it wasn’t okay! It wasn’t okay at all! I whimper and but my head against her hand. He was going to put the stick thing on me and make it make a loud sound.</div>
<div class="graf">He was walking towards us. I look up and shake out of her grip, standing between them and yelling at him. Don’t hurt Master! Don’t hurt her! I made you mad, not her!</div>
<div class="graf">He put his hands over his ears and yelled back at me, but it didn’t sound like anything important. Master put her hands up and stood up, in front of me. Why was she in front of me? Couldn’t she see the stick in his hand?! I couldn’t let him hurt her. Not again.</div>
	<div class="graf">He reaches his hand forward and grabs her hair. I lunge upwards and bite his arm, and he howls, but as he yanks his arm away he drags Master after him. This was what I was afraid of. I followed, yelling at him. He throws her down onto the ground in the hallway, just into the wall.</div>
<div class="graf">“You always pick the fucking dog over me! The fucking DOG! Why don’t you ever want to pick me or side with me, huh? Why are you out here loving the fucking dog more than your fucking HUSBAND?” I hear him shout at her. I need to stop this, I need to protect her. I need to protect Master.</div>
<div class="graf">I jump forwards and  bite his leg harder than earlier, and I feel the blood from his leg run down my teeth. I had to stop him, I had to stop him, I had to stop him.</div>
<div>He shakes me off with a scream and kicks me onto her. I yelp, and it hurt, but I stand up again, in front of her.  Not going to hurt Master.</div>
<div class="graf">He lifts out the black loud stick and points it at me. </div>
<div class="graf">“No, Don, no, please no,” I heard Master shout behind me, scared for the first time.
<div class="graf">The stick makes a quiet clicking sound.</div>
<div class="graf">Master pushes my side, trying to move me out of the way, but I cannot move. I growl, backing up into her. He already shouted at her, I do not want the stick shouting even louder at her, no sir, not today. I will not let this monster hurt Master anymore!</div>
<div class="graf">“Shut the FUCK UP!” The stick shouted.</div>
<div class="graf">The stick’s sound pokes a hole into my chest, through my heart, and I feel it burst. My knees bend and I fall, and I feel Master grab me and hug me. The rain falls down, just like when we first met, and it gets my fur wet, but we’re inside. How did the rain get inside? I lick her wet face, but my tongue is not moving like it usually does. If I lick enough, the rain will come off, right? That’s what got her to laugh and pet me, that day, when it was raining and she found me and gave me the chicken.</div>
<div class="graf">The loud stick clicks again, but quietly, and he says something angry and loud again. I could not hear him. I could barely hear anything over Master’s quiet breathing, her quiet sounds.  I protected her. I did it. Everything was turning to black around me. Master picks me up and I smell her all around me, keeping both of us safe. I had protected her. The sounds of the door, opening then closing, her panting breath and the wind whipping around us, and slowly the scent of him melts away into the air. I protected her. I let my head lean against her chest, almost expecting her to push me off like she usually did, since I was only allowed on her lap. She pats my side, and my vision goes black finally while I look up at her rainy face. </div>
<div class="graf">I protected her. </div>
