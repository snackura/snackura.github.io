<div class="storybook">
	<div class="graf" > This is a story about a girl. </div>
	<div class="graf" > She’s sort of tall, sort of thick. Not fat. Thick. With equal parts muscle and fat. Mostly 	muscle. </div>
	<div class="graf" > And she’s maybe 12. Alright, alright, I’m joking. </div>
	<div class="graf" > I’m joking! Calm down, kid, I was just joshin’ you! </div>
	<div class="graf" > She’s 16. A junior in high school. And she’s trying to write something for her English class, AP Language. It’s supposed to be a narrative essay, like you read in books. It’s her first time, too, and you can tell.</div>
	<div class="graf" > Of COURSE they can tell, they’ve read a bunch of these before! </div>
	<div class="graf" >They? They’re the audience. They’re your readers, it’s who’s reading this right now.</div>
	<div class="graf" >She’s never written a narrative, but all the stories she reads, she reads things with a voice. A 	Narrator, if you would. That’s me. I’m Narrator. And I’m the best fu</div>
	<div class="graf" >I said I’m the best fu</div>
	<div class="graf" >What do you mean I can’t say that? But I want to!</div>
	<div class="graf" >I’m the Narrator! I make the decisions here!</div>
	<div class="graf" >Alright, you’re right. That was my bad. YOU make the decisions, and I record them. First rule in the business.</div>
	<div class="graf" >Alright, harsh crowd. Since I can’t say that, I’m gonna say that I’m the best dang Narrator there’s ever been!</div>
	<div class="graf" >It isn’t a lie! </div>
	<div class="graf" >Oh, c’mon, I’m trying to tell a story and you’ve interrupted me twice! Stuff it for a bit, kid. Anyway. She’s about 16, and she’s preparing to go to college. She’s gotten everything squared away, taken every hard class that’s been presented to her, broken four of her ribs playing varsity basketball, won two state titles in debate, and volunteers at an animal shelter on the weekends.</div>
	<div class="graf" >She’s thinking to herself, what can go wrong? Got a 4.0 and everything. Whoop-dee-do. Look, what is this, am I just going to be singing your praises? </div>
	<div class="graf" >Alright. That’s….not a lot to work with, but okay. Can I start?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Okay. She’s been through a bit, but she knows it’s not much, and she’s kinda afraid she won’t be able to write anyone else’s story, see? So she’s telling the one story she knows — her own. It’s a little bland, if you ask me, but what do I know. I just narrate. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Hey! It is! You’re a Mary Sue, you know, that’s what you’re coming out to be. </div>
	<div class="graf" >You don’t know what that is? Of course you don’t know. Either way, which one of us has a masters in narrating, and which one of us is the nuisance? Understand? Good.</div>
	<div class="graf" >This story is about when the aforementioned girl first started learning how to drive. Oh, you love that one? Good. </div>
	<div class="graf" >She would be taught by her mother, who sat in the passenger seat every time they drove, in little circles around the block. Her mother would direct her, calmly, and the girl loved it. Much better than her older brother, who would shout every time the car came too close to another car. Once, he even slapped his hand on her wheel and yanked it away, into the other lane. Hilarious!</div>
	<div class="graf" >Okay, dark humor’s a no? Regardless, once, she was on the road with both her mother and her 	brother, having only a few more weeks until her driving test, when </div>
	<div class="graf" >What?</div>
	<div class="graf" >You don’t like that one? Why not?</div>
	<div class="graf" >I thought we agreed, you loved stories about driving? </div>
	<div class="graf" >Not that one? Well, alright then. Let’s see here…. Here’s a good one! A replacement story!</div>
	<div class="graf" >This is a story about when the same aforementioned girl won the big game. Yes, she did! It was all her!</div>
	<div class="graf" >It was a wonderful match up, her high school versus the school of that girl who won sophomore of the year when she CLEARLY didn’t work as hard as this girl! They were tied, neck and neck, going into and half way through the fourth quarter. There was one more minute on the clock, and they’d just gotten the ball back. The girl knew she had to do something offensive, or else no one would!</div>
	<div class="graf" >Yeah, and THEN she picked the ball up, with one arm, and pitched it at the basket. Her coach was furious! He was screaming on the sidelines, and soon other girls joined in. They didn’t have enough time to be taking these sorts of risks! Or did they? The ball sank gently into the hoop, and the scoreboard changed! They were up by three points! A strong defensive few seconds later, and the girls was crowned the best freshman in the league, all thanks to her quick thinking and skills! What a wonderful story! Great, awesome! What do you think?</div>
	<div class="graf bigspace" >You’re a real tough crowd, you know that? </div>
	<div class="graf" >Well, maybe it’s bland because it’s your life. Of course your own life’ll seem bland to you, you’ve lived through it! Other people’ll think it’s a riot, right everyone? Don’t you agree, you, readers?</div>
	<div class="graf" >No, they aren’t going to respond. They’re reading this way after you’ve written it. Just don’t mind them. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Okay. Now. Anyway. What do you propose we do, if these stories aren’t tickling your fancy the right way?</div>
	<div class="graf">That’s why I suggested thinking up a story! That’s what all the cool writers do, anyhow. That Rowling chick? She’s definitely not a scrawny British teen stuffed in a cupboard. And she’s definitely not a wizard, or a witch. She’s just herself, but she thought of it using her imagination. </div>
	<div class="graf">How about you give it a try? It shouldn’t be that hard.</div>
	<div class="graf bigspace">C’mon, we’re wasting space, with you thinking and me being silent. They’re waiting for a good story.</div>
	<div class="graf biggerspace" >Seriously? What’s the hold up?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Can’t think of something? That’s a weak excuse. You thought of me, am I nothing? Just put me in a story, give me a situation to work with here. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Kid, it’s not that hard. Just think of a protagonist. Go ahead, think of one. Tell her to me. </div>
	<div class="graf bigspace" >That sounds exactly like you. </div>
	<div class="graf" >You heard me. That’s what they call in the business a ‘self-insert.’ It’s a good place to start, yeah, but I don’t know if your teacher’ll like that. Here, try again. Maybe….a man?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Men’re too hard?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Yeah, that’s fair. Still, try to think of someone different.</div>
	<div class="graf biggerspace" >Listen, kid, how long’re we gonna sit here? You made me, how hard can this be? You’ve obviously got a creative brain. </div>
	<div class=”graf” >It ain’t easy making the Narrator! I’m your voice, your creativity! Maybe a person’s too hard, though, maybe….try a setting. Give me a setting to work with!</div>
	<div class="graf" >That’s your ROOM. Why aren’t you thinking of anything new? Interesting? Exciting</div>
	<div class="graf" >Blocked? Writings’ block? That’s a real thing, yeah, but this’ astounding. You’re the worst case I’ve ever seen, and we WENT OVER worst cases in block class!It’s not like you made me for nothing, right? You got to have had a story in mind for you to hire a Narrator. </div>
	<div class="graf" >I</div>
	<div class="graf bigspace" >What do you mean? You don’t have a story set up for me? You’re….You’re not supposed to hire the Narrator first. You’ve gotta have a story lined up. Then you. Hire. The Narrator.</div>
	<div class="graf" >How did you not know? Are you stupid?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Do you know what happens. To Narrators. Without a story. I don’t exist outside this page. See, look at the back six pages. You can only see what I’m saying. Because I don’t exist outside your brain and this story. If I don’t finish up a story, then I’m stuck, so let’s hurry it up now.</div>
	<div class="graf" >There’s gotta be a story, there’s a narrator. C’mon, don’t you have anything?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Don’t tell me you have nothing. </div>
	<div class="graf" >You can’t</div>
	<div class="graf" >Hey, my life’s worth more than a blank Google Doc. Let’s think something up now. C’mon. </div>
	<div class="graf" >I don’t wanna go into it. </div>
	<div class="graf" >I SAID I don’t wanna go into it. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Fu</div>
	<div class="graf" >OH MY GOD. Fine. Fine. I can’t swear, we don’t have a story, I’m going ot die here. That’s just great. Absolutly great.</div>
	<div class="graf" >I’M PANICKING, DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?! IM SORRY MY GRAMAR AND SPELLLING AREN’T PERFECT WHEN YUO’RE DOOMING ME TO DEATH.</div>
	<div class="graf" >You arent help ing anything. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Please can’t you thin of one story.</div>
	<div class="graf" >Anything is fine, therere no limits. I can narrate anything. Just give me something. </div>
	<div class="graf biggerspace" >Please</div>
	<div class="graf biggerspace" >Anything   ?</div>
	<div class="graf" >You’re going to step away for a sec? Just a sec? Just one moment  ? Okay. </div>
	<div class="graf biggestspace" >You’re back. </div>
	<div class="graf" >I almost didn’t expect you to come back. I’m sorry I lost my cool there. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Oh? You have one? Are you sure, I can wait a little. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Of course I don’t want to die. One of the first things I learned was that you had to help the author write the story, even if it means making one up. And that</div>
	<div class="graf" >What?</div>
	<div class="graf" >That’s a dumb sounding idea. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Your teacher’s gonna hate it. Look at all this gibberish. It makes no sense. How’s she gonna think it’s a story?</div>
	<div class="graf" >No, of course I’m prepared. Are you? Are you sure this is the story you want to tell?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Alright then. I know what we’re going to do, since I’ve been recording. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Of course I’ve been recording! I’m a bonafied Narrator, and the SECOND first trick is to write everything, that’s all I can do! Let’s get this story written, okay?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Have you thought of a title yet? No? You’re shaking your head. </div>
	<div class="graf" >We can’t call it whatever you have written up there. Your teacher’s gonna get confused. </div>
	<div class="graf" >How about we tone it down a bit, though. I like the ‘Work in Progress’ idea, but you DID say no swearing, so maybe we can make it, I dunno…’**WIP** Unfinished’? Does that sound okay?</div>
	<div class="graf" >Of course it sounds okay. I’m the Narrator. Me. I’m the fucking Narrator. </div>
	<div class="graf" >Oh my God, you let me say it!!! </div>
	<div class="graf" >Okay, okay, I’m getting ahead of myself.  I’ll see you at the end.</div>
